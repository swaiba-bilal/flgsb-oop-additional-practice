# Event Mnagaer
## Introduction
In this challenge, you'll apply your Java date and time knowledge to build a simple event scheduler application. This hands-on challenge will help you master essential date/time operations by creating a practical tool that manages events across different time zones.

You'll create a system that allows users to:
- Add events with date, time and timezone information
- Display events in various date formats
- Calculate event duration
- Convert event times between different time zones
- Find upcoming events within a specific timeframe

This challenge reinforces all the key concepts from the lab: retrieving current date/time, formatting dates, parsing date inputs, adding/subtracting time units, and converting between time zones - all within a real-world application context.

#### Challenge Description
Create a Java application that manages a list of events. Each event should have a name, date, time, duration, and timezone. The application should provide the following functionality:
1.	Create events: Allow users to add events with a name, date, time, duration, and timezone.
2.	Display events: List all events, formatting the dates in user-specified formats.
3.	Calculate timing: Find the time until an event starts from the current time.
4.	Convert timezones: Display event times in different timezones.
5.	Find upcoming events: List events that will occur within a specified number of days.

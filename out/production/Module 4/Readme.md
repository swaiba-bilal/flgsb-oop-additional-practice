# FileSystemManager

In this challenge, you'll create a File and Directory Management System using Java. This hands-on exercise will help you apply key concepts from Java's file handling capabilities. You'll build a console application that allows users to navigate and manipulate the file system, reinforcing concepts of object-oriented programming, recursive methods, and file I/O operations.

#### By completing this challenge, you'll gain practical experience with:
- Working with Java's java.io.File class
- Navigating directory structures
- Creating, renaming, and deleting files and directories
- Using recursion to process nested directories
- Building an interactive command-line interface

This challenge extends the lab content by asking you to create a more feature-rich application with a different approach to the user interface.
#### Challenge Description
Create a Java application called FileSystemManager that provides a file explorer with the following capabilities:
1.	Display the current working directory
2.	List files and directories in the current directory
3.	Navigate into subdirectories (cd command)
4.	Navigate up to the parent directory (cd .. command)
5.	Create new files and directories
6.	Delete files and directories
7.	Rename files and directories
8.	Search for files by name pattern
9.	Show detailed file information (size, last modified date, etc.)

Instead of using numbered menu options like in the lab, your application should implement a command-line interface similar to shell commands. For example, the user could type ls to list files, cd documents to change directory, or mkdir new_folder to create a directory.
